### id_selectors

##### fix text
```
so let's look at some examples of `ID` selector and `CSS` selector lookup in this lecture
and go to `Legacy` styles as well as `AMD` styles that we discussed in previous lecture
and I'll give you an example website where you can go and practice traversing techniques that you learn in this lecture
and try to modify and look up the nodes that you want on the website
the first one is `ID look up in Legacy` Style
so let's go back to the example that we were looking at in the first lecture which is a simple hello world
now if you see I gave an `ID` attribute to this `H1` and it's called `test`
```

### id selector
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>id selectors</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script src="./dojo.js"></script>
    <script>
        dojo.ready(
            function () {

                // id read data
                var idTitle = dojo.byId("title");
                
                // get first element in the Array
                console.log(idTitle);

                // get first element in the Array and then inner html
                console.log(idTitle.innerHTML);

                // id modify data
                idTitle.innerHTML = "Goodby";

                // get first element in the Array
                console.log(idTitle.innerHTML);
            }
        );
    </script>

    <h1 id="title">Hello</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

#### output 
```
<h1 id="title">Goodby</h1>
Hello
Goodby
```

### continue - fix syntax/text

```
Dojo Legacy Styles syntax, we write the script tag and inside the script tag we write Dojo tag
inside the `dojo.ready(`) we write our `function () { }` which will wait until the Dom has finished loading
and then start excluding the statements.
`H1` tag is loaded after this Dojo `not ready` function, but it will be executed after the dom is loaded
because I'm writing it inside the `dojo.ready` so I will say Dojo `dojo.byId` `title` and
I will send it to a variable `idTitle` and listen to the variable
I will try to do a `console.log`, the `dojo.ready` function and inside the dojo `not ready` function
I'm writing my function where I'm trying to read the `title` node which is `H1` node and the `inner HTML` of this
`H1` node is nothing but `hello world` so in the console
I'm trying to lock the inner HTML of the ID name `title` to see how this works
```

### Notes:
* dom - Document Object Model.
* dojo.byId - read data from id.
    ```
       var idTest = dojo.byId("test");
    ```
* idTitle.innerHTM - write data to id.
    ```
       idTitle.innerHTML = "Goodby";
    ```
