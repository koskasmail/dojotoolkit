# s03.05_id_selectors

### id_selectors

```
so let's look at some examples of `ID` selector and `CSS` selector lookup in this lecture
and go to `Legacy` styles as well as `AMD` styles that we discussed in previous lecture
and I'll give you an example website where you can go and practice traversing techniques that you learn in this lecture
and try to modify and look up the notes that you want on the website
the first one is `ID look up in Legacy` Style
so let's go back to the example that we were looking at in the first lecture which is a simple hello world
now if you see I gave an `ID` attribute to this `H1` and it's called `test`
```

### id selector
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>id selectors</title>
</head>
<body>
     <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/dojo/1.14.1/dojo/dojo.js"></script>
    <script>
        dojo.ready(
            function () {
                var idTest = dojo.byId("test");
                console.log("dojo >> output");
                console.log(idTest.innerHTML);
            }
        );
    </script>

    <h1 id="test">Welcome</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

### continue

```
Dojo Legacy Styles syntax, we write the script tag and inside the script tag we write Dojo tag
inside the `ready` we write our `function` which will wait until the Dom has finished loading
and then start excluding the statements.
`H1` tag is after this Dojo not ready function but it will be executed after the hit song is loaded
because I'm writing it inside the dojo.com so I will say Dojo dot bye ID test and I will send it to a variable let's say I didn't call to now this will look up the test known with test ID and it will listen to the variable I will try to do a console.log I don't know HTML Okay so what I did here is I wrote the dojo.ready function and inside the dojo not ready function I'm writing my function where I'm trying to read the test node which is H1 and the inner HTML of this H1 node is nothing but hello world so in the console I'm trying to lock the inner HTML of the ID name test to see how this works
