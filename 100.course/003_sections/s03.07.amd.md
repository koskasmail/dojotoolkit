## AMD

* We have learned legacy style will will continue win and style.
* AMD style is a modern style of query
* AMD style uses the same libraries "dojo.js"
```
    <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/dojo/1.14.1/dojo/dojo.js"></script>
```
* AMD style use define and require methods
* To use this method we will need to add to the cdn 
    * `data-dojo-config` 
    * is context of the dojo that loads on the web page and define how your configuraion shold control the dojo.
    * `data-dojo-config` have a property call "async=true"
    * "async=true" - Enable dojo i a sync mode (support only at amd ).
        * and let load/unload the modules you need in the required 
        * "async=true" by default is 
```
 <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/dojo/1.14.1/dojo/dojo.js" data-dojo-config="async=true"></script>
```

### dojo.config

```
   dojo config is a javascript object with a set of parameters 
   that are loaded when you include the `dojo.js` library file on the web application.
   inside `dojo.config` there are a lot of parameters: async, packages, baseUrl, config, cash, locale, afterOnLoad.

   There are some more parameters but they are not loaded by default.
   All these parameters are configurable and can be change or added or removed any of those parameters based on your application needs.
   To understand the AMD concept let us try to look at this pattern called `async`.

   by default I did not change anything I did not modify anything it loaded async value as `LegacyAsync`  
   so a little background about this is by default Dojo conflict loads the dojo library in `none Async format`
   which is synchronous format which is the older version of Dojo format this is done for
   Backward Compatible purposes and if you want to Leverage The AMD style
   you need to modify this is `async` parameter to `true` that is what AMD stands for .
   once It is enabled as `true` you can start using the `required` and `Define` functions in AMD
   to include the `modules` that you want and you can start leveraging those models.
   
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
data-dojo-config="async=true"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/dojo/1.14.1/dojo/dojo.js" data-dojo-config="async=true"></script>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   when enabling `async=true` we cannot use  `dojo.ready{ function({ } });
   -!- When you are enabling passing through you cannot use `folder or Legacy version of dojo ready`
       you need to use `AMD style of dojo ready`

#### AMD style of dojo ready

```
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <script>
        require(["dojo/dom","dojo/domReady!"],function(){
        
        }); 
    </script>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

inside the function...
There is an exclamation mark [`!`] at the end of the "dom/domReady!" module.
This exclamation mark [`!`]  is a plugin that handles the way that the AMD loader behaves on the web application.
it is an indicator to tell the application to wait until the `Dom` is loaded before this function is executed. 
usually you will need include a call back a parameter when the call back a function, a model that you are using a reference to the Callback function.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"dom/domReady!" module
is the model that will wait that will make the function wait until the Dom is loaded before the down can be accessed.

"dom/dom"
allow you to travel and look up the nodes.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

that will wait that will make the function wait until the dam is loaded before the down can be accessed and like I said 

you need to pass a `reference` to the callback function.
for this module you just don't have to pass the reference for "dom/domReady!" module  (You have an exclamation mark [`!`] at the end.
```

#### callback function
```
callback function,
in  any other modules we will need to pass a callback function,
it is a standard practice to keep the `name` same as that of the `module` that you are using so I will say (dom) 

require(["dojo/dom","dojo/domReady!"],function(dom) {
            console.log("test");
 }); 

you are not required to give `dom` as the name as Dom.
we can can give it as any name (like: 'test') and it will still refer to the `dojo/dom` module

require(["dojo/dom","dojo/domReady!"],function(test) {
            console.log("test");
 }); 

but to keep consistency and to make the code readable you will name the same you name this parameter
by the module that you're including.
