## AMD

* We have learned legacy style will will continue win and style.
* AMD style is a modern style of query
* AMD style uses the same libraries "dojo.js"
```
    <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/dojo/1.14.1/dojo/dojo.js"></script>
```
* AMD style use define and require methods
* To use this method we will need to add to the cdn 
    * `data-dojo-config` 
    * is context of the dojo that loads on the web page and define how your configuraion shold control the dojo.
    * `data-dojo-config` have a property call "async=true"
    * "async=true" - Enable dojo i a sync mode (support only at amd ).
        * and let load/unload the modules you need in the required 
        * "async=true" by default is 
```
 <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/dojo/1.14.1/dojo/dojo.js" data-dojo-config="async=true"></script>
```

### dojo.config

```
   dojo config is a javascript object with a set of parameters 
   that are loaded when you include the `dojo.js` library file on the web application.
   inside `dojo.config` there are a lot of parameters: async, packages, baseUrl, config, cash, locale, afterOnLoad.

   There are some more parameters but they are not loaded by default.
   All these parameters are configurable and can be change or added or removed any of those parameters based on your application needs.
   To understand the AMD concept let us try to look at this pattern called `async`.

   (1:20)
by default I did not change anything I did not modify anything it loaded async value as Legacy acid so a little background about this is by default Dojo conflict notes the dojo library in non-essing format which is synchronous format which is the older version of Dojo format this is done for Backward Compatible people purposes and if you want to Leverage The AMD style you need to modify this is parameter to true you want to set the async value to true that is what AMD stands for and once I think is enabled as true you can start using the required and Define functions in AMD to include the modules that you want and you can start leveraging those models

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
data-dojo-config="async=true"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/dojo/1.14.1/dojo/dojo.js" data-dojo-config="async=true"></script>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(continue from)
so let's see how it is done in the script I will say data dojo
```



### tag inside tag css selectors
