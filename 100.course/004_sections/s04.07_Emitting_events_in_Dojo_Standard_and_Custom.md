# s04.07_Emitting_events_in_Dojo-Standard_and_Custom



------unsorted------

hi so we have seen how events are triggered how events can be handled using the dojo on module and how even handlers can be removed when the even handling is no longer required okay so like I said before Dojo on module is really very powerful it allows you to handle the events when they occur it also allows you to dispatch new events Whenever there is a requirement so what does dispatching events mean it means triggering the events manually on demand even though the events have not really happened so consider a scenario where you want to invoke the button click Handler but nobody has click that button okay you can use something called method in the dojo on module and Trigger the button click event no there are two types of events that you can emit okay first one is the native event such as Mouse click double click Mouse enter mouse leave Etc the second one is custom events so you can write custom events to perform some custom actions that you want on your application we will see examples
