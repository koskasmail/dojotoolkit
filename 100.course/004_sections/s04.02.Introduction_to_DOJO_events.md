### intro

```
* DOM functions:
   * query
   * create
   * place
   * destroy.

* events handling / DOM events
before getting into DOM functions we will need to understand the concept Dojo "events handling".
"events" are scenarios that get triggered when certain actions are performed on a "web page" either by the user or by the application.
events let us Define what we want to do on the web page when those actions are performed.

example:
There is an image on the page and when the user hover on the image It will zoom in to the area the mouse is located.

In the example we saw "events" happens, we will capture that events, and we will do something whatever this event occurs.
`events` handling provides us a way to interact with JavaScript and Dom elements on the web page.

Dojo events handling is done differently by different browsers and different versions of the browsers so we need something that is really consistent and that something where you can write it once and use it across multiple browsers without any rework
events handling is really important if you are trying to build responsive and interactive web applications
because on your applications you want to be able to generate new events based on user actions or listen to events
when they happen and do something on your application

don't you provide a module called Dojo on module to handle events so here is a list of commonly used events in our JavaScript Mouse click Focus blur change keep press Etc Dojo supports all these events through events handling and it also supports creation and triggering of custom events based on our requirements and scenarios the dojo on module is really powerful it provides functionality for events listening and events dispatching events listening whenever we are trying to handle the events whenever the events is triggered and we want to perform something functionality is useful whenever we are trying to create or generate new events

JoJo on module is lightweight it's very fast and it supports all the modern browsers like I said earlier Dojo on module abstracts all the cross browser events models and it provides us a consistent way of events handling mechanism across all the browsers now let's take a look at the syntax of on
