# s04.02.Introduction_to_DOJO_events

### intro

```
* DOM functions:
   * query
   * create
   * place
   * destroy.

* events handling / DOM events
before getting into DOM functions we will need to understand the concept Dojo "events handling".
"events" are scenarios that get triggered when certain actions are performed on a "web page" either by the user or by the application.
events let us Define what we want to do on the web page when those actions are performed.

example:
There is an image on the page and when the user hover on the image It will zoom in to the area the mouse is located.

In the example we saw "events" happens, we will capture that events, and we will do something whatever this event occurs.
`events` handling provides us a way to interact with JavaScript and Dom elements on the web page.

"events" handling is done differently across different browsers, we will need something that work across different browsers..
That something will be written once and will be used across multiple browsers.

"events" handling is important for building a responsive and interactive web applications
listen to events when they happen and generate new events based on user actions and do something on your application when it do happen

* "Dojo on module" (JavaScript) handle events commonly used
    * "click" - Mouse click a node.
    * "focus" - a node received focuse.
    * "blur" - a node was blurred/lost focus.
    * "change" - an input was changed.
    * "keypress" - fired when the user presses a key that displays.
    * "keydown" - fired for non=printable keys.
    * "keyup" - fired when the user releases a key.
    * "mouseover" - a node was hovered.
    * "mouseout" - a node was un-hovered.
    * "dojo/mouse#enter" - like "onmouseover" (fire more then you'd like)
    * "dojo/mouse#leave" - like "onmouseout" (fire more then you'd like)
    * "submit" - a form was submitted.

* Dojo on module provides functionality for "events" listening and "events" dispatching.
   * "events listening" occurs when we are trying to handle the events
   * "events listening" also occurs when the events is triggered.
   * when it happens, we will want to perform an action and we will call "events" functionality.
   * "events listening" is useful whenever we are trying to create or generate new events.

* "Dojo on module" is lightweight, fast, supports all the modern browsers events models and events handling.

------------------------------------------------------------------
   require(["dojo/on", "dojo/domReady!"], function(on){
             on (target, "event" function(e)
             console.log('handle the evnet');   
           });
    });
------------------------------------------------------------------

require the "dojo/on" module to make it available for you on the page.
and inside the Callback function you provide it a reference to Dojo "on" method

example:
"function(on)"

inside the "on" method there are 3 arguments
1. target - target mode on which you are trying to create events
2. event - actual event (like a click or a double click or other event handle.
3. function - the function that will be triggered whenever this event is triggered.
   * inside function there is an argument called "e".
   * "e" argument is event object that have all the common properties of the event object.
   * event object like "target of the event", "bubbles up to parents", "cancelable or not" etc.

example:
on (target, "event" function(e)
```
