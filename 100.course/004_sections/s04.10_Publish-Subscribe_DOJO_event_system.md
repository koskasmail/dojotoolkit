`Publish & Subscribe`


```
hi in the previous lectures we have learned about the dojo even handling mechanism using various functions and methods provided by the dojo on module we have seen how to create events we have seen how to handle the events we've seen how to remove the handlers without saying how to create some custom events and handlers also all those topics all those methods and the all the examples that we have seen consider a Target no as a producer of a particular event so whenever we are trying to trigger events or whenever we are trying to write even handlers we always assume there is a target node that is producing those events now imagine a scenario where there is no node but you want to emit events and you want to handle those events

Dojo has an event system called publish And subscribe which serves the exact same purpose there is no reference to any object or node in this methods there will be a publisher and there will be subscribers and the publisher doesn't have to worry about who subscribes to it and this publish And subscribe even system is part of the dojo/topic module there are two methods like I said in the dojo/topic module first one is publish which is used to publish content second one is subscribe which is used to subscribe to the topic that's being published so whenever I say subscribe it is equivalent to even handling whenever I say publish it is equivalent to even triggering imagine the dojo published subscribe event system as a YouTube channel subscription mechanism a channel is equivalent to Topic in the published subscribe event system and whenever you want to get updates from a particular YouTube channel you subscribe to it similarly whenever you want content from a particular topic you subscribe to the particular topic using the topic whenever new content is published using the topic.publish method all the subscribers received the updated content and it is up to the subscribers how to interpret the updated content and how to use it for their custom logic there are three different ways of writing Syntax for publish And subscribe in the latest versions of dojo all of them have the first mandatory parameters as the topic name
```

#### method #1

```
now in method one the first parameter like I said it's mandatory it's the topic name the second parameter is an array of string parameters the Subscribe method will also have the first parameter as the topic name and the second parameter is an event handling function which will receive the area of string parameters as a single object and that object is an instance of an array so whenever you get that in the even handling code you pass that array you read the elements that have been sent in the published method and you use it for your own custom logic 

the first parameter again is the mandatory topic name parameter and after that instead of specifying the other parameters as a string of parameters you're free to use the parameters as independent strings so you can specify any number of parameters following the topic name and all those parameters will be received by the subscriber in that order so all the parameters that you have sent using topic published will be sent to the even handling function of the Subscribe method in the same order so they will receive Paragon to parent 3 Etc so what if you the publish is sending more than one parameters and you accept just one parameter in the Subscribe method it always sends the parameters in the same order that they are published so if you are reading one parameter you will be reading the first parameter bottom one in this case and you can use it in your event handling code to write your own custom logic the last

------------------------------------------------------------------
///----[method #1]----///

    /// publish
    topic.publish("topic_name", [param_1, param_2,....]);

    /// subscribe
    topic.subscribe("topic_name", function(params){
        ///----[event handle code]----
    });
------------------------------------------------------------------

```

#### method #2

```
in the second method the first parameter again is the mandatory 
topic name parameter and after that instead of specifying the other parameters as a string of parameters you're free to use the parameters as independent strings so you can specify any number of parameters following the topic name and all those parameters will be received by the subscriber in that order so all the parameters that you have sent using topic published will be sent to the even handling function of the Subscribe method in the same order so they will receive Paragon to parent 3 Etc so what if you the publish is sending more than one parameters and you accept just one parameter in the Subscribe method it always sends the parameters in the same order that they are published so if you are reading one parameter you will be reading the first parameter bottom one in this case and you can use it in your event handling code to write your own custom logic the last


------------------------------------------------------------------

///----[method #2]----///

    /// publish
    topic.publish("topic_name", ["param_1", "param_2",....]);

    /// subscribe
    topic.subscribe("topic_name", function(param_1, param_2,....){
        ///----[event handle code]----
    });
------------------------------------------------------------------
```


#### method #3


```

the last method uses a JavaScript object instead of an array of strings as the second parameter the first parameter again is same it's the mandatory topic name parameter the second parameter contains pair of key values which will be sent to the subscribers as a single object instance and that object will have all the properties as the key value Pairs and whenever you subscribe to such kind of Topics in the Subscribe method in the call back even handling function the object will have key back Keys as properties of the object which you can access by saying parent P2 in this scenario on the topic names that are used across the code must be unique and there is no globbing alone meaning let's say there is a topic name called topic one and then there is a topic name called topic 2 and topic 3 you cannot subscribe to all the topics by saying topic star so that custom pattern matching is not allowed if you are subscribing to a particular topic you need me to subscribe to the topic name as a whole and all the published events will be sent to the Subscribe method


* topic name must be unique, no globle name allowed.
* subscribe return an event handle, and can be removed.

------------------------------------------------------------------

///----[method #3]----///

    /// publish (key:value pair)
    topic.publish("topic_name", [p1:"param_1", p2:"param_2",....]);

    /// subscribe
    topic.subscribe("topic_name", function(params){

        ///----[event handle code]----
        params.p1...
        params.p2...

    });
------------------------------------------------------------------
```

#### handle.remove() method

```
all the Subscribe method calls will return an even handle like all the even handles are returned in the dojo on module methods you can remove the handle to stop listening to the TV by saying handle dot remove so whenever you say topic dot subscribe and say that handle equal to topic subscribe and whenever you're done you can just say handle lot removed but removes the handle and your subscription no longer works so whenever new content is published to the topic that you're subscribed to you won't get involved.

------------------------------------------------------------------

///----[method #4 -- handle remove method]----///

    
    /// publish (key:value pair)
    topic.publish("topic_name", [p1:"param_1", p2:"param_2",....]);

    /// subscribe
    var handle = topic.subscribe("topic_name", function(params){

        ///----[event handle code]----
        params.p1...
        params.p2...

    });

    handle.remove();

------------------------------------------------------------------
```
