hi 
in the previous lectures we have learned about the dojo `dom style module` which we can use to
control and manage the individual CSS properties of a node now in real world applications writing inline CSS files
is not a good approach instead we used waterfall CSS classes to define the styles for nodes.

class is nothing but a collection of CSS attributes that you want to apply to a particular node.
a node can have multiple CSS classes based on the use case, but classes are normally used in order to maintain a consistent look and feel across the application.
for example if you go to a application like amazon.com 
and look at the buttons irrespect of which page you are on the buttons will all look like 
similarly if you look at the select boxes or input fields or HTML tables they all maintain the same look and feel because behind the scenes there will be reusing a set of common classes across all the pages
