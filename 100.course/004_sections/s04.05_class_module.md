### class module
```
class -
a class is a collection of css attributes.
a class module uses waterfall CSS classes to define the styles for nodes (html element).

note -
a node can have a multiple classes.
a class is a collection of CSS attributes that we want to apply to a particular node.
a node can have multiple CSS classes based on the use case (System requirements in the program),
and it used to maintain a consistent look and feel across the application.

Dojo has a module called `Dom class module` to work with classes in the web application.
The Dom class module contains five methods:
contains, add, remove, toggle, replace.


The Dom class module methods:

1. `contains` method
The `contains` method accepts two input parameters
`node` and `class`.
The the `contains` method check if node contains a particular class, it 
return a  boolean `true` if exists, `false` if not exists, otherwise `false`.

2. 'add' method
The `add` method add a `class` to a `node`. 
Note: If the class you trying to added is exists, it will be ignored.

3. `remove` -
remove class from a node.
Note: If the class you are trying remove is not exists, it will be ignored. 

4. toggle method - 
toggle method `add` a particular class if it not exists in node.
toggle method `remove` a particular class if it exists in node.

5. replace method - 
The replace method `replace` an exists class with a new class in a node.

Note: The Dom class module methods are helpful to manage styles in an application.
