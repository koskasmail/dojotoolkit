# s03.04_Dom_query

### unsorted
```
In the previous lecture we have learned what is promise  and what is mode are.
let us try to understand how to Traverse the dom and  how to retrieve the node from the dom.
Dom is actually the main structure of your web page and node are the little pieces of webpage that you want.
There are two ways you can retrieve the node first one is by looking up  the `ID` of the node and second one is by looking at the `CSS select` 
`ID look up` is fast it is used in cases where you need to look at a single node and the note that you're trying to look up needs an
`ID attribute` for it to be avaiable on lookup. 
The syntax is straight forward you just say by `ID` and you get the `id` of the node that you're looking for and Dojo will retrieve the node that you're looking for.
