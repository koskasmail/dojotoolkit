**To create a learning folder path with the Dojo Toolkit, you should organize your project using a modular structure that supports Dojo's AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) system.**

Here's a recommended folder layout and setup approach to help you get started with learning and building Dojo applications:

### 🗂️ Recommended Folder Structure for Dojo Projects

Organizing your project properly helps with scalability and maintainability. Here's a sample layout:

```
/myDojoProject
│
├── /dojo                # Dojo core library
├── /dijit               # Dijit UI components
├── /dojox               # Additional Dojo modules
├── /app                 # Your custom application code
│   ├── /models          # Data models
│   ├── /views           # UI views
│   ├── /controllers     # Logic and control
│   └── main.js          # Entry point for your app
├── /resources           # CSS, images, etc.
├── /tests               # Unit tests
├── index.html           # Main HTML file
└── build.sh             # Build script (optional)
```

### ⚙️ Configuring Dojo Loader Paths

To make your custom folders work with Dojo's module loader, configure `dojoConfig` like this:

```javascript
var dojoConfig = {
  baseUrl: "/",
  packages: [
    { name: "app", location: "app" },
    { name: "dojo", location: "dojo" },
    { name: "dijit", location: "dijit" },
    { name: "dojox", location: "dojox" }
  ]
};
```

This tells Dojo where to find your modules when you use `require(["app/main"], function(main) { ... });`.
